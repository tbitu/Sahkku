/**
 * The random CPU: the port of the retired C# `RandomPlayerAgent`, faithful decision for decision
 * except its re-roll, which is now probabilistic instead of always a re-throw (see `decideReroll`).
 *
 * It is the bot the Unity game shipped with, and its draw is deliberately preserved, quirk included:
 * it picks a random movable piece, then draws an index in `[0, 4)` and clamps it to that piece's
 * options — the pre-engine CPU's draw, which is *not* uniform over the real range. Its re-roll is a
 * fair coin flip drawn from that same stream: the shipped CPU re-threw every sáhkku unconditionally,
 * which kept it from ever spending a sáhkku on activating a queued piece, so most matches against it
 * ground out the whole turn limit into a draw (the mechanism is in the task's problem summary).

   * only way to activate a queued piece, so a CPU that always re-threw could never bring a new soldier
   * (or its queen) onto the track — once its three loose soldiers were captured it had nothing legal to
   * play, so most games against it ground out the whole turn limit into a draw; the ones that did end
   * were won by the re-thrower itself, nearly always by an early queen capture. The draw comes from the
   * bot's own stream so a seeded run still replays exactly; a source-less agent has no stream to draw
   * from and flips `Math.random` instead. That fallback is this method's own: `decideMove` answers a
   * missing source without drawing at all, by taking the first legal move.
