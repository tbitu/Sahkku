/**
 * The deterministic bot: a 1:1 port of `HeuristicPlayerAgent` in
 * `Sahkku/Assets/Scripts/RulesBridge/PlayerAgents.cs`.
 *
 * It is the controller's fallback whenever another agent fails to answer, so it has to be total,
 * synchronous and reproducible: it scores every legal move with the weights below and takes the
 * highest-scoring one, ties going to the first candidate. Nothing here mutates the live state — every
 * probe runs on a `GameState.clone()`.
 *
 * The weights are the reference implementation's own. They are larger and more finely graded than the
 * "+100 soldier / +1000 queen / +500 queen-safety" summary in the task's L1 contract, and unlike that
 * summary they include an activation bonus; the reference's values are kept because this task is a
 * port and the ported tests (`PlayerAgentTests.cs`, `BenchmarkTests.cs`) pin the resulting ordering —
 * in particular "prefer activating a waiting soldier over a simple advance", which a scoring table
 * without `ActivatingPieceScore` cannot express.
