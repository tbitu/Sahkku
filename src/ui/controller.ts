/**
 * The interactive match controller: the bridge between clicks (or bots) and the pure `RulesEngine`.
 *
 * The controller owns the match loop — roll, offer the optional re-roll, play out the moves, notice
 * the end of the game — and exposes the result as a plain `MatchViewModel` snapshot. It contains no
 * rendering code and touches no DOM type, so the whole interaction model can be exercised headlessly
 * by the test suite while the browser layer (`board.ts`, `dice.ts`, `main.ts`) only has to paint the
 * snapshot it is handed.
 *
 * Two invariants shape every method here:
 *
 * 1. **The engine stays the sole authority.** Legal actions are read from
 *    `RulesEngine.evaluateAllowedPlaces` / `legalMoves`, and a move is committed only after
 *    `RulesEngine.isLegalMove` confirmed it. A click on an illegal cell is dropped silently — the UI
 *    must never be able to corrupt the board.
 * 2. **The controller never advances the turn by itself.** Handing over is a rules decision, so it
 *    only ever happens inside `RulesEngine.applyMove`, `nextPlayerTurn` or
 *    `applyRerollDecision`. The controller mirrors whatever the engine decided.
 *
 * Four collaborators are injected rather than reached for, which is what keeps the class testable:
 *
 * - the **translator** (`../locale/i18n`) owns every string the snapshot carries, so switching language
 *   is a `setTranslator` call followed by a repaint;
 * - the **sound player** (`../audio/audio`) receives one cue per committed action, derived from the
 *   engine's own `RuleEvent`s;
 * - the **seats** (`humanPlayers`) say which owners may act on this device, so a bot's turn cannot be
 *   played by a stray click — and a bot cannot be stalled by one either;
 * - the **bot driver** ({@link BotDriver}, below) plays the automated seats through this class's
 *   `*Automated` actions, which are the same engine calls, gated to the other kind of seat.
